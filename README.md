# Go-Beginner
Here is a simple example of how to implement a backend using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication in Go. This example will cover basic user login, JWT generation, and JWT validation.


## Prerequisites
#### Initialize a new Go module in your project directory:
```sh
go mod init Go-Beginner
```

Before you start, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Gorilla Mux: For routing.
- JWT-Go: For handling JWT.

#### You can install these dependencies using go get:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
go get -u github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4
```

## Directory Structure
Here's a suggested directory structure for the project:

```sh
Gobank/
│
├── main.go
├── handlers.go
├── jwt.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```
